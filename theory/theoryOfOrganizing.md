## Trust

Definitions:
    trust: An expectation or set of expectations of behaviour that one party (A) has for another party (B), and vice versa, to the extent of how much the parties rely on those expectations to change their current actions.

## Potluck

Let's take a simple example: a potluck with 3 people (A, B, and C). 

We need 3 different meals, one to feed each person. 
Let's say it takes an hour to prepare each meal. 

In a team of three, without trust, everyone doesn't rely on others to bring food. In this case, everyone makes 3 meals and it will take 9 hours of labor time to create the event. 

With limited trust, we can rely on others to make things under supervision. In this case, we can imagine members A and B watching C make the first meal. Once that meal is finished and verified, they start the next one. B and C watch A cook this time. Lastly, A and C watch B cook. The whole process still takes 9 hours collectively (each person was there for 3 hours) but only 3 consecutive hours in real-time. Our trust this time saved us 6 real-time hours and 6 extra meals made, but our lack of trust is still costing each member to be around for 2 more hours than they would be if we had more trust.

With more trust, we can finish all the work in 1 real-time hour. By distrubiting the labor out, each person makes one meal alone and trusts that the other two are doing the same. The process takes place over the course of 1 hour on the clock with 3 total labor hours that are embodied in the final result.

## Down and Back

By defining trust in terms of labor time, we can quantify some of the social aspects of organizing that tend to be overlooked because they don't easily fit into the concept of "building power" which is usually defined relative to influence over instruments of capital. The volumes of Capital give a bridge between labor time and instruments of capital so I will not do that extensively here. This work is inline with femenist writers such as Silvia Federici who pulled the realm of household labor into marxist cannon by considering it in terms of reproductive labor.
